        {
                question: "console.log('5' + 3)",
                correctAnswer: "'53'",
                explanation: "In this case, the + operator is used for string concatenation when one of the operands is a string. JavaScript converts the number 3 to a string and concatenates it with '5', resulting in '53'."
            },
            {
                question: "console.log('5' - 3)",
                correctAnswer: "2",
                explanation: "The - operator triggers numeric coercion. JavaScript converts the string '5' to a number and then performs the subtraction operation. Thus, 5 - 3 results in 2."
            },
            {
                question: "console.log(typeof ('5' + 3))",
                correctAnswer: "string",
                explanation: "When '5' + 3 is evaluated, it results in '53' (a string). Therefore, typeof ('5' + 3) is 'string'."
            },
            {
                question: "console.log(typeof ('5' - 3))",
                correctAnswer: "number",
                explanation: "The - operator coerces both operands to numbers, so ('5' - 3) is a number. Therefore, typeof ('5' - 3) is 'number'."
            },
            {
                question: "console.log('2' + 3 * 4)",
                correctAnswer: "'212'",
                explanation: "This statement evaluates based on the operator precedence in JavaScript: Multiplication (*) has higher precedence than addition (+). So, 3 * 4 is evaluated first, resulting in 12. The expression now becomes '2' + 12. The + operator between a string and a number causes string concatenation. JavaScript converts 12 to a string and concatenates it with '2', resulting in '212'."
            },
            {
                question: "var a = 5\nconsole.log(a++)\nconsole.log(a)",
                correctAnswer: "5, 6",
                explanation: "The first line prints 5 because a++ is the post-increment operator, which returns the current value of a before incrementing it. The second line prints 6 because a has been incremented after the previous line."
            },
            {
                question: "console.log(a+)",
                correctAnswer: "SyntaxError",
                explanation: "The line console.log(a+) will throw a SyntaxError because + by itself is incomplete and doesn't form a valid expression."
            },
            {
                question: "console.log(typeof NaN)",
                correctAnswer: "number",
                explanation: "When you run console.log(typeof NaN);, it prints 'number' because NaN is technically classified as a numeric value, even though it represents an invalid or undefined number."
            },
            {
                question: "console.log(NaN === NaN)",
                correctAnswer: "false",
                explanation: "NaN represents an invalid or undefined number, and the logic is that if a value is 'not a number,' it shouldn't be equal to any value, including itself."
            },
            {
                question: "console.log('1234' + 4321)",
                correctAnswer: "'12344321'",
                explanation: "The + operator with a string results in string concatenation. JavaScript converts the number 4321 to a string and appends it to '1234', resulting in '12344321'."
            },
            {
                question: "console.log('14999' - 14998)",
                correctAnswer: "1",
                explanation: "The - operator triggers numeric coercion. JavaScript converts the string '14999' to a number and then performs the subtraction operation, resulting in 1."
            },
            {
                question: "console.log(1 < 2 < 3)",
                correctAnswer: "true",
                explanation: "The reason 1 < 2 < 3 works as expected is because the comparison is between numbers, and the result (true) is compared to 3 afterward."
            },
            {
                question: "console.log(3 > 2 > 1)",
                correctAnswer: "false",
                explanation: "In 3 > 2 > 1, the first comparison results in true, but then true is treated as 1, which leads to the unexpected result when compared to 1."
            },
            {
                question: "console.log(2 + 3);",
                correctAnswer: "5",
                explanation: "This is a simple addition operation. The number 2 is added to 3, and the result is 5, which is printed to the console."
            },
            {
                question: "console.log('Hello' + ' ' + 'World');",
                correctAnswer: "'Hello World'",
                explanation: "The + operator in JavaScript is used to concatenate strings. In this case, it joins 'Hello', a space ' ', and 'World' into the string 'Hello World', which is printed to the console."
            },
            {
                question: "console.log(10 / 2);",
                correctAnswer: "5",
                explanation: "This is a simple division operation. The number 10 is divided by 2, and the result is 5, which is printed to the console."
            },
            {
                question: "console.log('The result is ' + 5 + 10);",
                correctAnswer: "'The result is 510'",
                explanation: "When using the + operator with a string and numbers, JavaScript treats the operation as string concatenation. So, 'The result is ' is concatenated with 5, then with 10, resulting in 'The result is 510', instead of performing the arithmetic addition."
            },
            {
                question: "console.log(5 * '2');",
                correctAnswer: "10",
                explanation: "In JavaScript, when you multiply a number by a string that contains a valid number, JavaScript will try to convert the string to a number and then perform the operation. In this case, '2' is converted to 2, and 5 * 2 results in 10."
            },
            {
                question: "console.log(10 % 3);",
                correctAnswer: "1",
                explanation: "The % operator returns the remainder of a division. When 10 is divided by 3, the remainder is 1. Therefore, 1 is printed to the console."
            },
            {
                question: "console.log(5 + '10' - 3);",
                correctAnswer: "507",
                explanation: "The expression starts with 5 + '10'. Since one operand is a string, JavaScript concatenates the number 5 with the string '10', resulting in '510'. Then, when subtracting 3, JavaScript converts the string '510' to the number 510, and performs the subtraction 510 - 3, which results in 507."
            },
            {
                question: "console.log(true + 1);",
                correctAnswer: "2",
                explanation: "In JavaScript, the true value is automatically converted to 1 when used in arithmetic operations, and false is converted to 0. Therefore, true + 1 becomes 1 + 1, resulting in 2."
            },
            {
                question: "console.log('3' + 2);",
                correctAnswer: "'32'",
                explanation: "When a string ('3') is added to a number (2), JavaScript performs string concatenation, not addition. So, '3' + 2 results in the string '32'."
            },
            {
                question: "console.log(10 / '2');",
                correctAnswer: "5",
                explanation: "When dividing a number (10) by a string ('2') that can be converted to a number, JavaScript converts the string to a number and performs the division. So, 10 / 2 equals 5."
            },
            {
                question: "console.log(10 - '2');",
                correctAnswer: "8",
                explanation: "When subtracting, JavaScript converts the string '2' into a number and performs the arithmetic operation. Therefore, 10 - 2 equals 8."
            },
            {
                question: "console.log(5 === 5);",
                correctAnswer: "true",
                explanation: "The `===` operator checks for strict equality. Since both values are the same and have the same type (number), the result is true."
            },
            {
                question: "console.log('2' * '3');",
                correctAnswer: "6",
                explanation: "When multiplying strings containing numbers ('2' and '3'), JavaScript converts them to numbers and performs the multiplication. Therefore, '2' * '3' equals 6."
            },
            {
                question: "console.log([] == false);",
                correctAnswer: "true",
                explanation: "When comparing an empty array `[]` with `false` using `==`, JavaScript converts both to primitive values. An empty array is coerced to an empty string, which is then converted to 0, and `false` is also converted to 0. Therefore, the comparison returns true."
            },
            {
                question: "console.log('hello' == 'Hello');",
                correctAnswer: "false",
                explanation: "The `==` operator checks for equality but is case-sensitive. Since 'hello' and 'Hello' have different cases, the result is false."
            },
            {
                question: "console.log(0 === false);",
                correctAnswer: "false",
                explanation: "The `===` operator checks both value and type. 0 is a number and false is a boolean, so they are not strictly equal, and the result is false."
            },
            {
                question: "console.log(5 + 10 + '20');",
                correctAnswer: "'1520'",
                explanation: "When performing addition in this order, JavaScript first adds 5 and 10, which results in 15, then concatenates '20' to it as a string, producing '1520'."
            },
            {
                question: "console.log('10' * '2');",
                correctAnswer: "20",
                explanation: "When multiplying two strings containing numbers ('10' and '2'), JavaScript automatically converts them to numbers and performs the multiplication, resulting in 20."
            },
            {
                question: "console.log('Hello');\nconsole.log('World');",
                correctAnswer: "Hello, World",
                explanation: "Both `console.log('Hello')` and `console.log('World')` are executed sequentially. Each `console.log` prints its string on a new line, but the final output is a single line with 'Hello' and 'World' printed together."
            },
            {
                question: "let a = 5; \nconsole.log(a); \na = a + 2; \nconsole.log(a);",
                correctAnswer: "5, 7",
                explanation: "In the first `console.log(a)`, the value of `a` is 5, so it prints 5. Then, `a` is increased by 2 (a becomes 7), and the second `console.log(a)` prints 7."
            },
            {
                question: "let x = 'apple'; \nlet y = 'pie'; \nconsole.log(x); \nconsole.log(y);",
                correctAnswer: "apple, pie",
                explanation: "The first `console.log(x)` prints the value of `x`, which is 'apple', and the second `console.log(y)` prints the value of `y`, which is 'pie'."
            },
            {
                question: "let sum = 10 + 5; \nconsole.log('The sum is:'); \nconsole.log(sum);",
                correctAnswer: "The sum is:, 15",
                explanation: "First, 'The sum is:' is printed, followed by the result of the calculation (10 + 5), which is 15. The correct answer is: The sum is:, 15"
            },
            {
                question: "let str = 'JavaScript'; \nconsole.log('Language: ' + str); \nconsole.log('Length: ' + str.length);",
                correctAnswer: "Language: JavaScript, Length: 10",
                explanation: "The first `console.log` outputs 'Language: JavaScript' by concatenating 'Language: ' with the value of `str`, and the second `console.log` outputs the length of the string 'JavaScript', which is 10. Both results appear in one line. The answer is: Language: JavaScript, Length: 10"
